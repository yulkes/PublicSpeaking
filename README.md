## [Great Engineering in the Worst Work Environment](GreatEngineeringWorstEnvironment)

Imagine the worst possible engineering work environment: Strict dress code, fast employee turnaround with median age of 19, people gone for 2 weeks in the middle of a project, requirements and priorities that change monthly. Oh, and there's no internet access.
