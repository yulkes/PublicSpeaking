# How We Ditched Our Apps - And Built a Robot Instead
## Meekan's luckily-successful journey into Chatbots

My partners and I cofounded Meekan, a calendar scheduling platform, raised funding, and went the standard way - develop iOS, Android and Outlook apps for it.  
A year later we had 3 apps, lots of code, not much money and and very few users.  
As one last shot, we tried meeting our users where they were - in an up-and-coming work tool called Slack. Only problem - The only integration we could write there was a chatbot.

This talk goes over everything we learned throughout the process, the benefits and mind-shift of moving your UX from a native app to a Conversational Experience.
